  These packages are for use with the INITIATE testbed service.  They
  are used to manage the Corsa DP2*00s that sit at each site, to
  produce wide-area Ethernet segments.

  <p>A command-line utility {@link
  uk.ac.lancs.networks.apps.Commander} is intended as the user front
  end.  It takes a configuration file, which identifies networks to be
  instantiated, along with database access parameters.  It then obeys
  commands on the command line to add terminals to networks, link
  terminals between networks, allocate bandwidth and labels, and
  create and modify services.  It is intended to be used with the
  persistent network implementations in {@link
  uk.ac.lancs.networks.persist}, which will store their state in a
  database, as it quits as soon as all commands have executed.</p>

  <p>The main programmatic interfaces are in {@link
  uk.ac.lancs.networks} (user-oriented service creation defined by
  interconnection of circuits) and {@link uk.ac.lancs.networks.mgmt}
  (management of terminals and links).</p>
